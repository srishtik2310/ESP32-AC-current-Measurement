# ESP32-AC-current-Measurement
In this Repository you will find all details on how to measure AC current using microcontroller and current sensor module like ACS712.
We are going to meaure the AC current by means of current sensor module ACS712 by RMS(Root Mean Square) method by relevant code.
We are going to use Arduino IDE to upload codes to the micro-controller.
